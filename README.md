live priview at: https://world-population-assignment.netlify.app/

* I have the ability for the user to choose statistics between continents. When the user selects a continent:
  * the distribution of the population in each country will appear on the graph.
  * I will show a list of buttons for all the countries on the same continent.
* When the user selects a country:
  * the distribution of the population in each city will appear on the graph.
* I Created a spinner when the data is loading.
* The website is responsive.
* All countries buttons are dynamic, generated on the fly.
